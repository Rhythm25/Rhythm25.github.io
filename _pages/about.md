# Ruizeng Li (李睿增)

I am currently a Ph.D. student at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), advised by Prof. [Ligang Liu](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~lgliu/). I also collaborate with Prof. [Beibei Wang](https://wangningbei.github.io/) on research projects. Prior to this, I received my Bachelor's degree from USTC in 2021. My research interests lie in rendering in computer graphics, and I am currently working on material modeling for realistic rendering.
